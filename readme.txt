== Description ==

This plugin installs a shopping cart button in the navigation bar. The plugin takes less than a minute to setup, 
and only displays when the following two conditions are true:

1. A menu name is set to **cart**. 
1. At least one item is in the shopping cart.

If one or both of these conditions are not met, the cart button will not display.

Finally, the cart automatically conforms to your site's styles, leaving you with no extra work.

**Note:** A version that includes a shopping cart image (via FontAwesome) is available free at https://www.wpovernight.com/plugins

== Installation ==

Extract the zip file and just drop the contents in the wp-content/plugins/ directory of your WordPress installation and then 
activate the Plugin from Plugins page. Once the plugin is activated navigate to Appearance > Menus. Change the name of your 
header menu to **cart** and click save. Everything else is automatic!
